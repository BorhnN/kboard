Do you hate people as much as I do?
Do you find yourself wasting time trying to find the right condescending message in order to get rid of them?

Then you need kboard - a keyboard designed specifically to end conversations. Don't waste time with all those other superfluous letters when all you really need is 'k.'.

* Add as many custom keys as you want

* One-click send option for the pinnacle of laziness

Designed to save you hours of pointless talking!
